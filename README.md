##Exposition
This project is backed by a new understanding of html5 principles:
- semantics
- lists
- forms

It also uses a modified version of BEM formatting in the CSS style sheet. The CSS guidelines found in BEM is about writing [maintainable and scalable CSS](http://cssguidelin.es/#bem-like-naming).

From [The Odin Project's](http://www.theodinproject.com/html5-and-css3/html-forms) curriculum.

##Excursions
Thanks [@codyloyd](https://github.com/codyloyd) for suggesting the [Nunito](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Nunito?selection.family=Nunito) font which is quite similar to the original.
- You first embed the font in the HTML: `<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Nunito" rel="stylesheet"> `
- Then you specify it in the CSS: `font-family: 'Nunito', sans-serif;`

Thanks [@kevinmulhern](https://github.com/KevinMulhern) for the `overflow: hidden` CSS tip to keep the background colours of parent containers visible while developing the page. (It can also be fixed by adding a fixed height for the parent element or by using the `clear` setting.)
